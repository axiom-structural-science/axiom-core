## Title
**AXIOM: A Universal Structural Framework for Analyzing Explanatory Completeness in Scientific Systems**

## Abstract
We present AXIOM, a symbolic framework for structural analysis of scientific explanations across domains. Using 18 fundamental procedural nodes, AXIOM quantifies explanatory completeness via Structural Truth Index (STI) scores and identifies specific architectural gaps. Validation across neuroscience, physics, ecology, and computer science demonstrates cross-domain applicability and meaningful completeness assessment.

## Key Contributions
1. **Universal Structural Grammar** - 18-node symbolic system
2. **Quantitative Completeness Metric** - STI scoring  
3. **Cross-Domain Validation** - Physics to neuroscience translation
4. **Open Source Implementation** - Publicly available framework

## Methods
- Symbolic mapping from natural language descriptions
- STI calculation based on node presence/absence
- Iterative parser improvement (v1.0 → v1.4)
- Cross-domain testing protocol

## Results  
- 495% STI improvement on physics examples through iterative refinement
- Accurate structural pattern recognition across domains
- Meaningful gap identification in explanatory models
