- Fixed word boundary issues
- **Restored**: "Energy flows" and "Water cycles" detection
- Maintained physics improvements

### v1.4 - Advanced Variations  
- Explicit word variation handling
- **Critical fix**: "memories" → "memory" mapping
- **Breakthrough**: "Electrons orbit" improved to 0.495 STI
- **Optimal balance** of precision and recall
